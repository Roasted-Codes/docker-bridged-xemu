# Grant xemu network capabilities for pcap/bridged networking
# =============================================================================
# This script runs as root during container init (before xemu starts).
# It grants xemu the ability to open raw sockets on network interfaces,
# which is required for the pcap backend in bridged networking mode.
#
# Why here and not in autostart?
#   autostart runs as user 'abc' (uid 1000), which lacks CAP_SETFCAP.
#   custom-cont-init.d scripts run as root during s6-overlay init.
#
# Why register libraries with ld.so.conf?
#   setcap causes Linux to strip LD_LIBRARY_PATH (same as setuid binaries).
#   The AppImage's bundled libraries must be registered system-wide via
#   ldconfig so the dynamic linker can find them without LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
